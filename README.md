# Postman Clone 
Postman Clone provides a user-friendly interface for making GET requests to APIs and viewing the responses in formatted JSON. Ideal for developers and testers, this tool simplifies API interaction and debugging, helping you efficiently validate and troubleshoot your API calls. This is a project that helped me familiarize how to use the technologies involved. Credits to Tim Corey
